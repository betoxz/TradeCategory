interface ITrade

{
    double Value { get; }
    string ClientSector { get; }
}

Currently, there are three categories rules:

LOWRISK: Trades with value less than 1,000,000 and client from Public Sector

MEDIUMRISK: Trades with value greater than 1,000,000 and client from Public Sector

HIGHRISK: Trades with value greater than 1,000,000 and client from Private Sector


Imagine you receive a list of trades and you need to return a list of categories as below:

input: List<ITrade> portfolio

output: List<string> tradeCategories


Example:
Input:

Trade1 {Value = 2000000; ClientSector = "Private"}
Trade2 {Value = 400000; ClientSector = "Public"}
Trade3 {Value = 500000; ClientSector = "Public"}
Trade4 {Value = 3000000; ClientSector = "Public"}
portfolio = 
{
	Trade1, Trade2, Trade3, Trade4
}

Output:
tradeCategories = {"HIGHRISK", "LOWRISK", "LOWRISK", "MEDIUMRISK"}

Your design must take into account category rules can be added/removed/modified and will become highly complex in the near future.
